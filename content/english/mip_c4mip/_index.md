### Welcome to C4MIP

 The primary aim of C4MIP is to understand and quantify future (century-scale) changes in the global carbon 
 cycle and its feedbacks on the climate system, making the link between CO2 emissions and climate change. This 
 objective is obtained through idealized, historical and future scenario experiments.

C4MIP is a part of Opens external link in new windowCMIP6. C4MIP is closely linked to the recently initiated 
Opens external link in new windowWCRP Grand Challenge on Carbon Feedbacks in the Climate System.
